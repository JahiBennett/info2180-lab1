        <p style="text-align: justify;">
            As you may already Know, my name is Jahi Bennett and I am pursing a degree in Computer Science. All I wish to accomplish is to finish UWI with an honours degree with a good
            amount of accolades. I grew up mainly in St.Andrew with my grandmother then as turned 3 my mother placed me in Vaz Preparatory school where i learned for a total of 8 years.
            I moved to Wolmers' Boys School where I spent another 7 years which happened to be the place where most of my development happened. Where I met my current friends to date. 
            They helped me become the person I am today. I am interested in web development because it allows me to build interactive and useful web applications. I enjoy problem-solving
            and creating user-friendly interfaces.
